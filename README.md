# Workshop on property-based testing & test.check

Nov 15, 2015, at Clojure/Conj.

## What's going on here?

This repo contains all the materials you might end up needing at some
point.

## Starting a REPL

Starting a `lein repl` in the project in the `part-2-codebases`
directory will give you a repl with test.check namespaces already
required in the standard way:

```
cd part-2-codebases; lein repl
```

## Part 1

You'll be doing exercises at [this](http://4clojure.gfredericks.com)
site, and should take advantage of
[the cheatsheet](https://github.com/clojure/test.check/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet.md).

## Part 2

See the README in the `part-2-codebases` directory.
